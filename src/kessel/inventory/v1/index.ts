 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { ClientBuilder } from "@project-kessel/kessel-sdk/inventory/v1";
 *
 * const healthClient = ClientBuilder.builder()
 *   .withTarget("localhost:9000")
 *   .withInsecureCredentials()
 *   .build();
 *
 * // Use the health client
 * const response = await healthClient.check({});
 * ```
